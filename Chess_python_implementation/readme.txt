This was my project, which helped me to understand oop in python.

You dont need any additional libraries which are not part of standard python 3 libraries.
To start playing just use play_chess.py

Setup of the board is rather simple, there are basic chess rules, classical chess layout.
Additional elements can easily be applied.
